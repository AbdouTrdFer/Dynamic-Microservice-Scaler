# Dynamic-Microservice-Scaler
A dynamic microservice management system for horizontal scaling and resource optimization using Docker containers. The project automatically monitors container metrics (CPU and RAM usage) and scales the infrastructure by creating new instances when thresholds are exceeded. It includes a load balancer implementing the Round Robin algorithm.
